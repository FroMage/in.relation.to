From deep into the Nice mountains, St√©phane works for Red Hat on the Vert.x and Quarkus project.

Passionate hacker in Java, C, Perl or Scheme. A web standards and database enthusiast, he implemented among other things a WYSIWYG XML editor, a multi-threading library in C, a mobile-agent language in Scheme (compiler and virtual machines), and some Web 2.0 RESTful services and rich web interfaces with JavaScript and HTML 5.

Eager to share, he is a frequent speaker at various conferences such as the Scheme Workshop, Nice University, Devoxx, JavaOne, JavaZone, JAX, many Java User Groups as well as the Riviera Java User Group he co-leads. A long-time open-source user and advocate, he worked on Ceylon, RESTEasy, Redpipe, Reactive Contexts, jax-doclets, stamps.js and various Play! Framework modules.
